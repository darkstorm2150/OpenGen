<h3><p align="center">About OpenGen Project</p></h3>

OpenGen is an AI project focused on creating high-quality images through Stable Diffusion, a deep learning technique that leverages neural networks to generate realistic images. The project aims to provide an open-source solution for researchers and developers to experiment with and build upon.

The project began with the creation of the Protogen Model, which contains many models with different styles. From there, the project expanded with the addition of new models and techniques, each building on the previous ones.

OpenGen v1.0 is the result of consolidating all previous Protogen versions.

All checkpoints are in the safetensor format and saved as float32. The interpolation method used is a weighted sum, and the multiplier (M) is set to 0.95 for the final versions.

OpenGen is an ongoing project, and I welcome any contributions or feedback from the community. I hope that this project can help advance the field of AI and provide valuable insights into deep learning techniques.

# Stable Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Guide
